# Olympic-Medal-Count-Prediction


## Overview

- This project uses [**RandomForestClassifier**](https://www.ibm.com/topics/random-forest) to predict the medal count for various countries in the Olympic Games. 
- This repository contains all the codes and resources used to build and utilize the predictor.

## Steps

- **Data Collection**: Obtain historical Olympic medal count data for various countries.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for training.
- **Model Training**: Train the random forest classifier model using the preprocessed data.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the upcoming Olympic Games medals.
